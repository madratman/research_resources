[Global Symplectic Uncertainty Propagation on SO(3)](http:// -arxiv.org/pdf/0803.1515.pdf) 2008. The visualization figs are interesting. Try the 3 sphere viz. Although, I think it isn't intuitive.    
[Filtering Techniques for Pose Estimation with Applications to Unmanned Air Vehicles](http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4489&context=etd) This is goddam thesis! mmmm. "The second key contribution of this work is the Manifold EKF, a generalized version of the Extended Kalman
Filter which is explicitly designed to estimate manifold-valued states"

I'll never understand the following but should think of combining SO(3) and spheres with convolutions and go deep?

- [Convolution on the n-sphere with application to pdf modeling](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/170272/files/n_sphere_convolution.pdf)
- Spherical harmonics are like gabor filters but spheres, hmm so we need to learn sphere kernels, and rotate them inside sphere "images" (just to think visually). Check out this [gif of harmonics](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Rotating_spherical_harmonics.gif) from wiki

- [RL by David Silver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0)
- [robotics 1](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/~deluca/rob1_en/material_rob1_en.html), Prof. Alessandro De Luca
   - Aims: This course provides the basic tools for the kinematic analysis, trajectory planning, and programming of motion tasks for robot manipulators in industrial and service environments.
   - Contents: Typical robotic systems are illustrated through examples of manipulators and mobile-base robots in industrial and service applications. The basic functional components of a robot are presented: mechanics for manipulation, actuators, proprio- and exteroceptive sensing devices, control architecture, and programming. Direct, inverse, and differential kinematic models of robot manipulators are analyzed. Trajectory planning methods both in the joint and in the task (Cartesian) space are then explored. Simple control schemes are introduced, including kinematic control for robot arms and decentralized dynamic control for the single axes of a manipulator.

   - Aims: This course provides tools for: Advanced kinematics and dynamic analysis of robot manipulators; Design of feedback control laws for free motion and interaction tasks, including visual servoing.
   - Contents: Advanced kinematics for robot manipulators (calibration, redundancy resolution). Derivation and use of the dynamic model of robots (Euler-Lagrange and Newton-Euler formulations). Identification of dynamic coefficients. Inclusion of joint transmission elasticity. Linear and nonlinear control schemes for set-point regulation (PD with gravity compensation, saturated PID, iterative learning) and for trajectory tracking (feedback linearization and decoupling, passive control, robust control, adaptive control) in free motion tasks, as well as for interaction tasks with the environment (compliance control, impedance control, hybrid force/velocity control). Image- and position-based visual servoing (kinematic treatment). Special topics will be presented in a seminarial way: diagnosis of robot actuator faults; detection of physical collisions and safe reaction.
